## Tutorial


1. **Install the Kanbn extension** in Cursor IDE:
   - Open Cursor IDE
   - Go to Extensions tab (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Kanbn"
   - Install the extension (i am not affiliated with the developer. their github repo is https://github.com/samgiz/vscode-kanbn ) . as of 19jun2025 it seems secure. i have audited manually the downloaded extension.

2. **Create/Open a board**:
   - Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Kanbn: Create Board / Open Board"
   - The board is created locally in `.kanbn_boards/`

3. Download the project rule i have created from this repo you are reading now, and put it in your project (or create a user rule from it for global useage, but i can't recommend it)
